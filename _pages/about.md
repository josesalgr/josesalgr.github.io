Hi! I am currently a fourth-year PhD student at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) specializing in Statistics and Operations Research (OR). My research focuses on the use of OR methodologies in the management of conservation actions and contribute to decision-making in often complex problems. Applications include the creation of mathematical models to dynamically and spatially explicit plan appropriate management actions, using simulation and stochastic programming. I am advised by Prof. [Virgilio Hermoso](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mrSgHusAAAAJ&hl=es) and Prof. [Eduardo Álvarez-Miranda](https://fen.utalca.cl/profesor/eduardo-alvarez-miranda/).

Prior to UPC, I received my Bachelor’s degree from the University of Talca, Chile in 2017. Currently, I work at the Forest Science and Technology Centre of Catalonia (CTFC), Spain.
